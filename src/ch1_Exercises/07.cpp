//
// this program is a modification of a program from the text "AddIntegerList.cpp"
// Write a program called "AverageList.cpp" -- "07.cpp" in our case --
// that reads in a list fo integers representing exam scores and then prints out the average of them all.
// Because some unprepared student may get a 0, the SENTINAL should be -1 to mark the end of the input.
